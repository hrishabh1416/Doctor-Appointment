The Doctor Appointment App is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of booking, managing, and tracking medical appointments. Patients can register, search for doctors by specialty, and book appointments online, while doctors can manage their schedules and availability through a dedicated dashboard.

The system includes role-based authentication (Admin, Doctor, Patient) to ensure secure access. Patients receive booking confirmations and can view their upcoming appointments, while doctors can update availability and view patient details. Admins have full control to manage users, doctors, and appointments.

Additional features include secure login/signup with JWT & bcrypt, online payments (via Razorpay), cloud-based image uploads with Cloudinary, and real-time appointment status updates. The app also integrates form validation, responsive design, and a clean, user-friendly UI.

This project demonstrates strong backend logic with Node.js/Express, a responsive frontend with React, and efficient database management with MongoDB. It provides a practical and real-world solution for hospitals, clinics, and patients by reducing manual effort, saving time, and improving healthcare accessibility.
